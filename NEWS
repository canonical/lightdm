        all seats, and can override each setting in a per seat configuration.
      - Default seats are now specified using a [Seat:<name>] section.  If no seats
        are specified then one is started.  This can be overridden by setting
        start-default-seat=false in [LightDM].
      - Support setting autologin user to guest account
      - Split the user accounts configuration into /etc/lightdm/users.conf so the
        main config can be private.

        symlink to their chosen default or set one in lightdm.conf.

        completion.
      - start_session() is now called start_session_sync and blocks until
        completion. The quit signal is removed, and the greeter should quit if
        this method returns TRUE.
      - login() is now called authenticate()
      - Greeters now have hints instead of configuration (greeters should load their
        own configuration from /etc/lightdm if they need it).
      - liblightdm-gobject uses AccountsService if it is available
      - Added regression tests for liblightdm-qt
    * D-Bus API changes:
      - Expose Seats and Sessions on org.freedesktop.DisplayManager
      - Add a CanSwitch property
      - Rename ShowGreeter() to SwitchToGreeter()
    * Greeter changes:
      - Drop "example" from the name of the GTK+ and Qt greeters and make them
        official default greeters.

        maintained.

    * When using system authority the authority can be updated by the user.
    * Written X authority files now checks hostname and display number.
    * Enironment is no longer passed through to X servers and sessions, this is
      no longer required now PAM works correctly.

        work well.

    * Configuration changes:
      - Use /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf instead of /etc/lightdm.conf
