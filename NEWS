Overview of changes in lightdm 0.4.4

    * Allow minimum-display-number to be set in lightdm.conf and on the command
      line

      - Added two signals: select-user and select-guest.  This requires the
        greeter to select a user account for logging in.
      - Drop ldm_greeter_get_is_first() - it was added for testing and doesn't
        work well

      username.

      - Rename ldm_greeter_provide_secret to ldm_greeter_respond - responses
        may not be secrets.

      - show-message signal now has a MessageType field and takes over
        behaviour of show-error signal

      be interpreted as a failure in the current session.

      detected.  A new option minimum-vt is added to select the first
      VT to be used for other displays.

        and the username parameter is not required.

    * Configuration changes:
      - Use /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf instead of /etc/lightdm.conf

      - Make X server configuration a separate section and now has new options
